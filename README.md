# QOSF Mentorship Programme (Task 2)

Hello there!

I'm Ashish Panigrahi. This is my attempt at solving **task 2** for the [QOSF Mentorship Programme](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/). My solution can be found in **task2.ipynb**.

If you wish to quickly access the notebook instead of cloning and running it locally, refer to the corresponding [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paniash/qosf-mentorship/blob/master/task2.ipynb) hosted on [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

An important point to note if you're running the notebook locally is that, you have to save your IBMQ token to your local machine. This is because I have implemented some measurements using a noise model from the IBMQ Valencia backend, which requires the use of your IBMQ account.

Thank you!
